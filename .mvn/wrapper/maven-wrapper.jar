The file `my-spring-boot-app/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar` is a binary file that is part of the Maven Wrapper. It's not a text-based file, so it doesn't contain code that can be shown here. This file is typically included in your project when you initialize it with Maven Wrapper, and it's not something you would create or edit manually. It's used to bootstrap the correct version of Maven for your project.
